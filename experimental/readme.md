## Experimental
Below, a description of the tests made with the prototype. 

1. **Delay Tests** Were performed to understand the joint response to steps.
2. **Loadcell Tests** Were performed to evaluate the Loadcell aquisition quality.
3. **Fall Tests Were** perfomed to evaluate the joint dynamic behaviour.
4. **Software Step Tests** were performed to understand the joint response to steps.

The .csv files, with the data generated by the Arduino println are located in the [MATLAB folder](https://github.com/biopmr/ModExo/tree/master/matlab/arduino_tests), the images files are printscreens, photos, etc., containing graphs ploted in MATLAB, settings, setup other information.

### Low Level Controller Delay Tests
The joint response to a manual step input was tested for three different derivative gains. In these tests, the controller mode used was "EncoderControl", in which the reference position is given by turning the MA3 encoder by hand. The first PID gains, in delay_test_1, were defined by the Regulation Tuning Wizard from EPOS Studio 2.00. We hypothesised that the delay would decrease as the Derivative Gain increased. So, for the delay_tests_2 and delay_tests_3, the derivative gains were simply increased to verify the change in the system response.

Below are listed the datasets and the respective Lower Level Controller (the EPOS) PID gains. This datasets are the CSV data generated as the output of the [ModExo code version](https://github.com/biopmr/ModExo/commit/fbe45a4ca06b29ec54b75cb432308c84095bc77f).

#### Results
The graphs show two variables: the Theta Reference - in blue - corresponding to the signal of the MA3 Encoder, which gives the reference position for the low level controller and the Theta Tracking - in red - which corresponds to joint position given by the Joint Position Sensor.

The variable Delay is defined as the time gap between the instant of change in the theta reference and the instant of change in the theta tracking. As seen in the graphs, when the Derivative Gain is increased from 6919 to 15000 the Delay goes from 0.76 to 0.1 seconds, however, when increased from 15000 to 30000, no change is observed in the Delay.

The variable Settling Time is defined as the time gap between the instant when the theta reference reaches its final position and the instant when the theta tracking reaches its final position. Similarly to the Delay, when the Derivative Gain is increased from 6919 to 15000 the Settling Time goes from 1.67 to 0.91 seconds, however, when increased from 15000 to 30000, no significative change is observed in the Settling Time.

#### Discussion
Since the system dynamics will vary depending on the application, we are not concerned on finding an optimal relation between Derivative Gain and Delay: we are more interested in understanding the overall behaviour of the system.

The results indicate that an increase in the Derivative Gain will reduce the system response time up to a limit, which could be explained by a saturation of the actuators.

Further tests can be performed to observe the influence of the Integrative Gain, which should also result in a decrease of the Settling Time. Also, the step input can be made by software, to provide reptibility and other analysys possibilities. Issue #16 refers to this tests.

### Loadcell Tests
Static loadcell tests were made to evaluate the loadcell calibration presented below, which correspond to the code that converts the raw data from the straingauges to mNm. The joint was positioned in the horizontal position, at \theta = \pi/2 while different weights were attached to the extremity of the loadcell according to the Figure.

	// LoadCell Calibration 
	// [[loadcell_data_double = A*(force) + B]]

	float A = 0.00764; // slop steepness
	float B = 118712.7+5000; // offset
	float d = 0.105; // distance between the loadcell centers = 10,5cm  

	contactForce = (loadcell_data + B)*A;

![LoadCell Test Setup](https://biopmr.github.io/images/tests-loadcell-setup.png)

Three loads were applied to the loadcell and the procedure was made twice, generating two .csv data:  

	Weight 1: 5000g
	Weight 2: 2*1068.7g
	Weight 3: 528.8g

![LoadCell Test 1](https://biopmr.github.io/images/tests-loadcell.png)
![LoadCell Test 2](https://biopmr.github.io/images/tests-loadcell_2.png)

#### Results
The graphs show two variables: LoadCell Data and Calculated Torque. The first corresponds to the acquired data with the LoadCell, which has straingauges assembled in a wheatstone bridge. The second is the calulated Torque, respective to the different loads applied to the joint arm. It's also possible to notice a noise, which is due to the changing of the loads.

Three mean errors were calculated for each applied load. These are:  

	Mean Percentage Error 5kg = 0.0551
	Mean Percentage Error 2kg = 0.0374
	Mean Percentage Error 0.5kg = 0.339

#### Discussion
As expected, the mean percentage error did not show a linear correspondence with the applied load. A further evaluation of the impact of this error for the application is needed.

### Fall Tests
Two types of tests were made, in which the joint was released from the horizontal position at \theta = \pi/2 with a weight of 528.8g at the endpoint. In the first, the weight is left to fall freely, in the second, the weight fall is interrupted by a plateau. The tests were carried for two different impedances:

	i = 20
	b = 5
	k = 200

and

	i = 20
	b = 20
	k = 100

### Response to Software Position Step 
In the "Delay Test", the position reference was given by hand - possible to identify in Figures 1, 2 and 3 by a slighlty inclined theta reference step. In the tests shown below, the step was given by software, by setting the position setpoint as 50000qc or one quarter of a turn. The PID gains used were the same as used in *Delay Tests 2*: 
	Position Regulator P-Gain = 2655
	Position Regulator I-Gain = 4948
	Position Regulator D-Gain = 15000
 
  In these tests, the controller mode used was "EncoderControl", in which the reference position is given by turning the MA3 encoder by hand. The first PID gains, in delay_test_1, were defined by the Regulation Tuning Wizard from EPOS Studio 2.00. We hypothesised that the delay would decrease as the Derivative Gain increased. So, for the delay_tests_2 and delay_tests_3, the derivative gains were simply increased to verify the change in the system response.
